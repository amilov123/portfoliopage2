										<h2>Ethnographic Research Study of <strong>Pinches Tacos</strong></h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Project Overview</h3>
									<p>Our group conducted an ethnographic research study of a local Mexican restaurant chain, 
									Pinches Tacos. Our goal was to discover pain points, customer demographics and customer 
									experiences and how Pinches Tacos could increase their business. All customers surveyed liked Pinches Tacos
									as it is and reported they would make no changes and would not utilize online ordering nor delivery. I found that I could still infer a market
									that justifies a website redesign that includes using a takeout or delivery service solution such as uber eats or grubhub 
									if pinches can maintain a sufficient profit margin after the costs of using the solution's service are taken into account
									</p>
									<h3>My Role</h3>
									<p>I researched the background of Pinches Tacos and interviewed customers to learn about customer 
									views and craft a user persona  illustrating pain points and experiences of customers.
									 I then created a storyboard of an actual visit to Pinches Tacos. I conducted background business 
									 research to determine the costs and benefits of utilizing an online takeout or delivery
									service such as grubhub or ubereats to verify a market for such a website redesign</p>
									
									
									<h3>Initial Hypotheses and Initial Proposed Solutions</h3> 
									<p>During researching the background of Pinches Tacos and studying Pinches Tacos website
									we hypothesized that rebuilding the Pinches Tacos website and building a 
									functioning online ordering system to replace their nonfunctional order online link was a desirable goal.</p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pinches_summary.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Proto-Persona</h3>
									<p>We hypothesized a proto-persona of a Pinches Tacos customer</p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pinches_proto-persona.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>The Interviews Contradicted Our Initial Hypotheses;
									However Market Research Allows Us to Infer a Large Market Justifying a Website Design</h3>
									<p>After interviewing some Pinches Taco's customers. I determined that although 
									Pinches Taco's website could indeed look better and function better, if my interviewees 
									are indeed representative of the restaurant chains existing customers as a whole I could find 
									no evidence from customer interviews that ordering over the web was a desired service. 
									Every customer I interviewed said that they would not order online and that they prefer
									to place their orders in person. However, I conducted background Market Research that allows 
									us to infer a large untapped market of those who would utilize online takeout or online delivery ordering.

									The below quotes were obtained in a short interview of a pinches customer:</p>

									<h3>User Persona of Michael Lee Merrins for Pinches Tacos Ethnographic Research Study</h3>

									<p>I defined a user persona based on a long interview with another Pinches Tacos regular customer:</p>
		
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pinches_persona_michael_lee_merrins (3).png" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>Storyboard of a First Visit to Pinches Tacos</h3>
									<p>Below is a storyboard illustrating how an actual first visit  to Pinches Tacos went for me when I was brought to Pinches Tacos by a regular customer:</p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Pinches_final_storyboard_1.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Consequat Phasellus laoreet massa id in, tristique at erat lorem
									ipsum dolor sit amet lorem ipsum sed consequat magna tempus veroeros
									consequat magna tempus lorem ipsum consequat Phasellus laoreet massa id
									justo mattis pharetra. Fusce suscipit ligula vel quam viverra sit amet
									mollis tortor congue. Sed quis mauris sit amet magna.</p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pinches_user_journey_map_final.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Future Research Goals and Revised Potential Recommendations</h3>

									<p>To verify whether Pinches Tacos profit margin is sufficient to allow Pinches Tacos to utilize an third party 
									online delivery solution or takeout ordering solution to tap the large market that exists for online delivery and onlie takeout,
									 I would examine how Pinches Tacos profit margin is impacted by the fees that such solutions as Uber Eats and GrubHub charge. If the projections 
									from such analysis are insufficient from a third party online delivery solution, then I would suggest a redesign 
									allowing customers to click to call to place a takeout order.
									Currently the online ordering button link is non-functional.  
									Pinches Tacos may well be able to increase their business via their website, but constructing 
									an online ordering system of their own may not be indicated if my interviewees are representative. 
											â€‹
									Pinches Tacos may be better served by driving more business from their website by a 
									redesign that simply directs the visitors to their website  to use such services as Uber Eats 
									and Postmates to order food and removing nonfunctional online ordering links.  Using third-parties 
									to handle delivery might better drive new business.  Running their own online ordering system could 
									have large labor costs.  In addition, being listed as a restaurant choice on delivery apps could 
									enhance Pinches Tacos exposure and introduce the restaurant chain to new customers more efficiently
									due to the large user base such third-party apps have.  To generate pickup orders Pinches Tacos 
									could use a simple click to call link to allow customers to phone in pick-up orders and catering 
									orders or again utilize the strategy of directing those desiring pickup to a contracted third-party app or apps
									to take their pickup order.</p>
